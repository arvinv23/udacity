# Finding Which Way the Wind Will Take Me

This analysis dives into finding which neighborhood in Chicago will be the best to rent from in Chicago.
It will use data from 2017-2019, which I will estimate will be similar to what 2023 will look like after the Covid lull.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

I learned that upon further analysis, West Town and not the Loop would be the best area for me to live in.
This is based on average monthly reviews, sheer number of reviews, and price.
Learning this is very important because now I know which neighborhood will have the best bang for buck for when I do decide to visit the city next year.
